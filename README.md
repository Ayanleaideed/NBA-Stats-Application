# NBA Player Statistics Dashboard

Welcome to the NBA Player Statistics Dashboard, the final project for NDSU's Advanced Software Engineering with Frameworks (313) course. This application has been designed and developed over a period of 1.5 weeks by a dedicated team of four students.

## Project Overview

This web application provides a dynamic interface for users to interact with NBA player statistics. Built using Django, it features functionality for user authentication, live game updates, player stats retrieval, and more. Our goal was to create a responsive and intuitive tool for basketball fans and analysts alike to explore detailed player data and game information.

## Main Features

- **User Authentication**: Register new users, log in, and log out functionalities.
- **Live Game Updates**: Fetch and display live scores and upcoming NBA games.
- **Player Statistics**: Search and view detailed statistics for NBA players.
- **Efficiency Calculations**: Sort players based on their game performance using custom efficiency metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Web framework for building the application.
- **NBA API**: For retrieving up-to-date player stats and game scores.
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS**: For frontend interactivity and styling.
